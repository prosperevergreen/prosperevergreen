Hi, my name is Prosper. I am a front-end and back-end web/mobile application development software developer, proficient with various development frameworks and library. Currently, I am a masters student at Tampere University, Finland studying Software, Web and Cloud Technology.

I am a passionate and enthusiastic individual with excellent relationship building and communication skills, I love to design and create things.
I am comfortable developing on front-end or back-end.
I primarily use Swift, Vuejs or Nodejs but picking up a new framework is not a problem.
I have hands-on experience developing in the cloud (AWS, Google Cloud and Firebase etc), I have vast knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES5 and beyond), C++, Python and various modern frameworks and libraries such as Bootstrap, Vue, Nuxt, Vuetify, Express etc. I also have experience in deploying web application to the cloud.

I provide services such as web application development, API integration and development, Cloud development and more.
